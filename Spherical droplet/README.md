## Spherical Droplets  
This is an ongoing script on which I am working. Technically, I am calculating the density profile of the water droplet using cylindrical coordinate meshing. In doing so, "initial" and "box.inp" are used to generate a simulation setup on which we start doing our molecular dynamics simulation. Then, I need to have coordinates of the center of mass for the water droplet that can be calculated by "run" and "COM.py". The output is "results". The only  
thing that has to be done on that is to average. For COM, one needs to generate an index file that just has water oxygen. This index file also is used  
for other analyses because after all we have to generate all frames that we sampled using this index file. Later, these generated frames in cartesian coordinates are used to calculate the cylindrical coordinate meshing density.
