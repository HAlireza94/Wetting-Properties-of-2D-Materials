## Cylindrical Droplets  
This is a Python script that analyzes the dat file generated by GROMACS/LAMMPS and then estimates the water contact angle.  
The dat file is a density map where the density of the cylinder (water) is obtained along Z and X while averaging over y. To  
do so, first generate an index file where Oxygens of water molecules are selected: gmx make_ndx -f conf.gro -o index.ndx then  
in the promt, use "a OW". OW is the name of the oxygen for water molecule in my case, in your case, it could be different.  
Then, gmx densmap is used: gmx densmap -f prd.xtc -s prd.tpr -n index.ndx -aver y -od density.dat
